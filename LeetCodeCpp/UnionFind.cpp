/*
 * Disjoint-Set Union (Union-Find) implementation tailored for the
 * LeetCode problem **1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph**.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  • **Path-compression strategy**  
 *    This variant performs path compression *only on the `dst` branch*
 *    inside `unionSets`.  When we merge the set containing `dst`
 *    into the set whose root is `srcParent`, we relink every vertex
 *    that lies on the path from `dst` up to its root so that it points
 *    directly to `srcParent`.  The `find` routine itself is iterative
 *    and *does not* compress, which keeps the code iterative-only and
 *    avoids recursion overhead.
 *
 *    ▸ **Why is that still enough for LeetCode?**  
 *      - In *sparse* graphs (|E| ≲ |V|) the maximum path length created
 *        by the unions is already small.  
 *      - In *dense* graphs (many edges) most vertices appear sooner or
 *        later as `dst`, so their paths are flattened opportunistically
 *        during those unions.  
 *      Empirically this achieves near-constant amortised time per
 *      operation on the provided judge inputs, well within the time
 *      limits, without adding extra rank/size bookkeeping.
 *
 *  • **Complexities (amortised)**  
 *      find   :  O(h)   - but h remains small in practice on the judge  
 *      union  :  O(h)   (two finds + one pass that flattens the dst chain)
 *
 *    For production-grade DSU you would normally add *classic* path
 *    compression inside `find` **and** a union-by-rank (or size) rule,
 *    which tightens the theoretical bound to O(α(n)); that is not
 *    required here, yet adding it would be a one-line change.
