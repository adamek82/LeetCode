/*
 * This is Prim’s algorithm implemented with a min-heap (lazy updates).
 *
 * Educationally it’s fine, but for THIS problem the underlying graph is complete:
 * every pair of points forms an edge, so |E| ~= n*(n-1)/2 = Θ(n^2).
 *
 * Using a binary heap yields time Θ(E log V) = Θ(n^2 log n)
 * because we push Θ(n) candidates at each of n steps (Θ(n^2) total pushes),
 * and each push/pop costs O(log V) ~ O(log n). With the lazy pattern
 * (priority_queue has no decrease-key) many stale entries are popped and skipped,
 * but the asymptotics stay Θ(n^2 log n) and memory can hold Θ(n^2) queued pairs.
 *
 * A simple array-based Prim that scans all vertices to find the next minimum
 * runs in Θ(n^2) time and O(n) extra space, which is asymptotically and
 * practically better here (n ≤ 1000).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Result can approach ~4e9 in worst cases, so summing in 64-bit (long long) is safer.
 * - Keep this heap version if you want to mirror the typical sparse-graph implementation;
 *   for dense graphs prefer the O(n^2) array variant.

/*
 * Prim’s MST — array-based O(n^2) variant.
 *
 * Idea:
 * - Maintain S = set of vertices already in the tree.
 * - minDist[u] stores the cheapest edge from any v ∈ S to u.
 * - Each iteration:
 *     1) pick the unused vertex v with the smallest minDist[v] (safe by the cut property),
 *     2) add its cost to the answer and mark v as used,
 *     3) relax: for every unused u, set minDist[u] = min(minDist[u], w(v,u)).
 *
 * This chooses, in every step, the lightest edge crossing the cut (S, V \ S),
 * which belongs to some MST (cut property). After n iterations we obtain an MST.
 *
 * Complexity: O(n^2) time, O(n) extra space — better than heap O(n^2 log n) on a
 * complete graph.
