/*
 * How this in-place trick works (two bits per cell):
 *
 * Encoding:
 *   - We use the least significant bit (bit 0) for the current state:
 *       0 = dead now, 1 = alive now
 *   - We temporarily use the next bit (bit 1) to stage the next state:
 *       If a cell will be alive in the next generation → set bit 1: x |= 2
 *       After the pass, shift right once: x >>= 1
 *         → staged next state (bit 1) becomes the new current state (bit 0)
 *
 * Counting neighbors while mutating in place:
 *   - When summing neighbors, we use:
 *       count += board[I][J] & 1;
 *     This masks off all but the least significant bit so we only consider
 *     the *original* state of each cell, ignoring any staged writes to bit 1.
 *   - Loop ranges are clamped with max/min to avoid out-of-bounds access.
 *
 * Single compact if for all rules:
 *   - Recall: count includes the cell itself.
 *   - Alive cell survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors:
 *       → corresponds to count == 3 or count == 4 when board[i][j] is alive
 *   - Dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 neighbors:
 *       → corresponds to count == 3 when board[i][j] is dead
 *   - This can be merged into:
 *       if ((count == 4 && board[i][j]) || count == 3)
 *   - Notice: using board[i][j] (truthy if alive now) works here without &1,
 *     because the check happens before we set bit 1 for that cell.
 *
 * State promotion:
 *   - After staging next states in bit 1, we run:
 *       board[i][j] >>= 1;
 *     This discards the old state (bit 0) and promotes next state (bit 1 → bit 0).
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - Initially each cell is 0 or 1.
 *   - After the first pass, values are {0,1,2,3}:
 *       0 (dead→dead), 1 (alive→dead), 2 (dead→alive), 3 (alive→alive).
 *   - Masking with &1 guarantees correct neighbor counts.
 *
 * Complexity:
 *   - Time: O(m·n) since for each of m·n cells we scan up to 9 neighbors.
 *   - Space: O(1) extra; both states are packed into two bits per cell.
